# Michel Stahli's Projects

This repository showcases selected projects that reflect my research, coding, and analytical work. The projects include research reports, coding scripts, data analysis notebooks, and a short essay. These projects highlight my interest in environmental data analysis, applied statistics, and coding, all of which are central to my graduate school and career goals.

## Repository Contents

- **Research Projects**: Analyses conducted during my work at Boulder A.I.R. and a research project for an applied econometrics class.
- **Code & Notebooks**: Scripts written for data processing, visualization, applied machine learning, and curve correction fitting in the context of VOC analyte breakthrough. While some of the code has been adapted for readability and accessibility, the focus is on demonstrating my approach, problem-solving skills, and coding ability.
- **Short Essay**: A research proposal on economic development and inequality in China previously written for admission to Johns Hopkins' Master of Arts in International Studies (M.A.I.S.) program, with an international economics emphasis. 

Please note: Some of the code has been modified for privacy and readability. It is not intended for direct use, but rather to illustrate examples of my work. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
